### Description
This version of hangman is going to be a funny and also frustrating 
experience as opposed to the classic hangman games. However, if a player
intends to go for a highscore, this effort, will be rewarded. The customizable
settings make it so that you can adjust the game to your level.

### Features
	*   User settings are saved, and remembered, even after killing the app
	*   Highscore is determined based on difficulty settings, encouraging to
		challenge yourself with longer words, fewer tries and choice of game mode
	*   The user will get an in-game keyboard, simplifying the input
   	*   The current state of the to-be-guessed word is clearly displayed
